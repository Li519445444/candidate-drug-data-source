Anti-breast cancer drug candidate data


(1) ERα_activity.xlsx \n
     the biological activity data of 1974 drug compounds on Era and the biological activity value of the compound against ERα including IC50 and pIC50. The unit of IC50 is nM. The smaller the value, the greater the biological activity and the more effective it is to inhibit ERα activity. The pIC50 is the negative logarithm of the IC50, and this value is usually positively correlated with biological activity, that is, the larger the pIC50 value, the higher the biological activity. Generally, the pIC50 is used to indicate the biological activity.


(2) Molecular_Descriptor.xlsx \n
     729 molecular descriptor information for 1974 drug compounds. The molecular descriptor of a compound is a series of parameters used to describe the structure and properties of the compound, including physical and chemical properties (such as molecular weight, LogP, etc.), topological structure characteristics (such as the number of hydrogen bond donors, the number of hydrogen bond acceptors, etc.) and so on.
  
  
(3) ADMET.xlsx \n
